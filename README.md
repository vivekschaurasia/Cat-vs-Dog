# Cat-vs-Dog


## Introduction:

This model predicts the whether the given photo is of a dog or a cat. The accuracy obtained here 98% with 100 epoch.
The model is created in convolution neural network with keras library. 
The model is created in three parts. The initial stage is data preprocessing where we augment the data with keras.
In second part, we build the model with convolution neural network and in the last part we train it with "Adam" optimizer.

## Dataset:

The dataset can be found here.

The classification model is written in python language in a colab notebook environment.

##  List of Hyperparameters:

Parameters: batch_size, Learning _rate, epochs, Keep_probability, learning_rate_decay

## Accuracy:
After training 100 epoch, we got a accuracy of 98.5%
